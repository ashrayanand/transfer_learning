# transfer_learning

Deep Learning is awesome, it has given wings to computer vision and object detection/classification. However we need a lot of data to train a good detection model
which may not be readily available. We showed use the use of transfer learning to train a model on less data (<1000 images) and still getting good results (>80% accuracy) to
demonstrate use of transfer learning.
